The following categories follow Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_statistics)

- Basic Concepts
  - For describing situations
    - Incidence (epidemiology) vs. Prevalence vs. Cumulative incidence
    - All types of medical test results can be true positive or false positive and true negative or false negative...these categories are hugely dependent on the prevalence of the disease being tested for; and, for example, a false positive test result is more likely when the prevalence of the disease being tested for is very low (such as a lab test for cold-weather influenza being done in June in South Carolina, USA. and giving a "positive" result).
    - Transmission rate vs. Force of infection
    - Mortality rate vs. Standardized mortality ratio vs. Age-standardized mortality rate
    - Pandemic vs. Epidemic vs. Endemic vs. Syndemic
    - Serial interval vs. Incubation period
    - Cancer cluster
    - Sexual network
    - Years of potential life lost
    - Maternal mortality rate
    - Perinatal mortality rate
    - Low Birth weight ratio

  - For assessing the effectiveness of an intervention
    - Absolute risk reduction
    - Control event rate
    - Experimental event rate
    - Number needed to harm
    - Number needed to treat
    - Odds ratio
    - Relative risk reduction
    - Relative risk
    - Relative survival
    - Minimal clinically important difference

- Related statistical theory
  - Survival analysis
  - Proportional hazards models
  - Active control trials: Clinical trials in which a kind of new treatment is compared with some other active agent rather than a placebo.
  - ADLS(Activities of daily living scale): It is a scale designed to measure physical ability/disability that is used in investigations of a variety of chronic disabling conditions, such as arthritis. This scale is based on scoring responses to questions about self-care, grooming, etc.
  - Actuarial statistics: The statistics used by actuaries to calculate liabilities, evaluate risks and plan the financial course of insurance, pensions, etc.
